Wave after wave...

The Invaders keep coming marching left and right across the night sky, going faster and faster as they get closer to earth. As the last Sky Fighter your mission is to destroy as many Invaders as possible but your firepower is limited and the Invaders are endless.

Score as many points as possible by shooting Invader after Invader, the higher the rank the more points scored.
